Welcome to Haochen Wang’s Personal Homepage! 

I am currently a third-year PhD candidate at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, advised by [Prof. Zhiwei Xu](https://xuleek.tech/) and [Prof. Zhumin Chen](https://ir.sdu.edu.cn/~zhuminchen/~zhuminchen_en.htm). During this period, I also pursued robotics research under the supervision of [Prof. Dong Xuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=11NcM2EAAAAJ). My research interests are Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Model (LLM) Agents.
